# Mixtur

A VST3 that's a noisy radiophonic audio toolkit comprising a filtered noise source, dual ring modulator, comb filter and saturation with lots of intermodulation that can produce unexpected results.

Very much a work in progress at this point but checked-in code should build and work more or less as intended.
