# Mixtur

A VST3 that's a noisy radiophonic audio toolkit comprising a filtered noise source, dual ring modulator, dual comb filter, jitter and amp-like saturation with lots of intermodulation that can produce unexpected results. It accepts MIDI pitch information for tuning various parts of the circuit so it can also be used as a crude, weird synthesizer. 

Very much a work in progress at this point but checked-in code should build and work more or less as intended.
